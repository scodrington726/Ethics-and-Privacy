    "An example of misuse of health data is the case of Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta Lacks' cancer cells were taken without her knownledge nor consent during a cervical cancer biopsy at Johns Hopkins. Her cells that divided infinitely have contributed to the developing of medicine including the polio vaccine, cancer research, HIV, and Covid-19 studies. However, with this collection of her cells was highly unethical. First, they were collected without Lacks' informed consent. Second, her and her family for years were decived because of the false pseudonym her cells were held under. To prevent this from happening the providers could have properly informed and gained permission from Lacks to use her cells in this research."

    "An example of a breach in health data is the Yale New Haven Health case in 2025. This case invovled the unauthorized third-party access to private information including names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and medical records. This affected over 5.5 million people. Yale New Haven Health had to file for a 18 million settlement claim for those affected. Additionally, they had to notify all the individuals affected. Something that could have prevented this is extra security permissions and third party risk management."

    "An example of bias in health data collection is the temporal thermometers or also known as forehead thermometers. Forehead thermometers show racial bias in data collection. These thermometers tend to underestimate fevers in Black patients by about 26% compared to oral ones. This can lead to misdiagnoses and treatment delays. This can be prevented by collecting testing data on more diverse populations and ensuring consistency."

    "A method to anoymize health data is pseudonymization. This technique replaces personal data with made-up identifiers, codes or pseudonyms, to make data less linkable to individuals. This method still allows for re-identification. It ensures privacy for research by protecting the identities of those invovled."

    "1. The primary goal of data anonymization is to protect private or sensitive information and removing information that can connect an individual to stored data.\n",
    "2. The Havasupai Tribe case is about how researchers initally collected blood samples to conduct a study the tribe's prevalence of type 2 diabetes. This is a study they consented to. However, they did not consent to the researchers contiuning studies on their blood with other genetic markers. The ASU and Arizona Board of Regents were sued by the Tribe for a lack of informed consent.\n",
    "3. The largest data breach in history was in 2015 involving Anthem Inc. This was a due to a cyberattack that lead to hackers gain personal information of 78.8 million indivduals.\n",
    "4. The pluse oximeter controversy is about how pluse oximeters where racial bias towards Black patients. Being three times more likely to miss low blood oxygen levels in Black patients comapred to White patients.\n",
    "5. The role of the IRB is to make sure ethical standards are upheld in research and to protect research participants.\n",
    "6. The difference between a spreadsheet software and database software for health data management is databases are more secure and used for larger, more complex datasets while, spreadsheets are used for more simpler data collection and lack security measures.\n",
    "7. A conflict of interest in pubic health research is a situation where a person or organization invovled in the research has a secondary interest that could influence the conduct, finding, or reporting of the research. Conflicts of interest include finacial, personal and academic ones.\n",
    "8.  Informed consent in a health data collection context is consent that requires the individual to be provided with information to make an educated decision about their participation.\n",
    "9. Data masking in the context of de-idenfication of health data is replacing identifiable information with random characters or removal.\n",
    "10. The principle of K-anonymity in the context of de-identification of health data is the technique that involves grouping data in a way that each group contains \"k\" records, making it difficult to single out individuals.\n",
    "11. The main concern about conflicts of interest in public health research is compromising the research.\n",
    "12. The first step in managing conflicts of interest in public health research is transparency.\n",
    "13. The role of independent oversight in managing conflicts of interest in public health research is to provide an additional layer of scrutiny and to ensure these conflicts don't compromise the research.\n",
    "14. A strategy of mitigating conflicts in public health research is public disclosure. This is disclosing the conflict of interest to the public.\n",
    "15. The potential impact of not properly managing conflicts of interest in public health research is bias in research, loss of public trust, and damage to reasearch intergrity."
